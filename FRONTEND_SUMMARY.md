## Image Sources
All images sourced from Unsplash via Vision Expert Agent:
- Automotive: Pagani Zonda R (dark blue sports car)
- Aerospace: Hermeus Quarterhorse Mk 1 (cutting-edge aircraft)
- Energy: Wind turbines with dramatic sky

## Testing Results
✅ Hero section with Spline 3D animation loads correctly
✅ Tile modal popups work as expected
✅ All navigation links function properly
✅ Technology pipeline interaction is smooth
✅ Applications page images load and display correctly
✅ Contact form validates and submits successfully
✅ Toast notifications appear on form submission

## Mock Data Implementation
All data is currently mocked in `mock.js`:
- Tile details (Intelligent Simulation, Physics + AI, Digital Twins)
- Contact form submissions (stored in array)
- No database integration yet

## Next Steps for Backend Integration
When ready to implement backend:
1. Create API endpoints in FastAPI for:
   - Contact form submissions (POST /api/contact)
   - Newsletter subscriptions
   - Demo requests
2. Replace mock.js functions with actual API calls
3. Add MongoDB models for:
   - Contact submissions
   - Demo requests
4. Implement email notifications for form submissions

## Color Compliance
✅ Following 90/10 color rule strictly
✅ Large areas use pure black (#000000)
✅ Color accents limited to buttons, icons, and borders
✅ No gradients used (per design guidelines)
✅ High contrast for dark theme readability

## Performance Optimizations
- Spline lazy loaded with Suspense
- Images optimized via Unsplash CDN
- Minimal dependencies
- CSS transitions instead of animations
- No large background images
